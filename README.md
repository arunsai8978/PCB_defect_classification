PCB Defect Classification
1. Project Title
PCB Defect Classification using YOLO and Faster R-CNN.

2. Description
This project detects and classifies defects in Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) using object detection algorithms. It processes images and annotations, and highlights defects like missing holes, mouse bites, open circuits, and more using pre-trained models such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN.

3. Installation and Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repo-url>
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure that your dataset is organized into the correct subfolders (e.g., images, Annotations).
4. Usage
Run the main script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
The script will parse XML annotations, count image and annotation files, and display images with annotated defects.
5. Libraries used: YOLO, Faster R-CNN, OpenCV, Pandas, PyTorch.
